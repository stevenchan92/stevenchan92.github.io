  			<h4> Why Fusion? </h4>
  			<p> Fusion is what powers our sun (which, in turn, created almost all the energy we harvest in other ways).  Other renewables, like wind and solar, indirectly harness the fusion energy of the sun.  This same process can be used here on Earth to generate clean energy without the transmission losses or unpredictability of solar energy.  In addition to being environmentally friendly, our Fusion Engine is inherently safe.  Learn More about Fusion Energy. </p>

  			<h4>Why Now? </h4>

  			<p>The technology and engineering required for net-production fusion finally exists.  But the big government projects have either stalled or have spent billions of dollars chasing difficult-to-commercialize solutions.  By combining our years of experience in fusion, newly available electronics technologies, and a revolutionary design using cutting-edge physics, Helion is making a fusion engine 1,000 times smaller, over 500 times cheaper, and realizable 10 time faster than other projects. </p>

  			<h4>Why Helion? </h4>
  			<p>We are a proven team of entrepreneurs and scientists who are making fusion happen.  The Helion team has designed and built award-winning technology and prototypes many experts in the field consider the most promising approach to commercial fusion. This is our lives’ work. </p>
