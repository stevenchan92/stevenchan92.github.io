<p> So recently I listened to Tim Ferris's podcast/interivew with Derek Sivers and he mentioned how he had created a Now page - something simple that tells the world what he's currently working on. You can check out the podcast here and he even made a site to showcase what other people are working on (see here). So I guess I'm gonna do one too so I can keep myself accountable for some of the short to mid-term goals I have in the upcoming year. </p>

<p>As of this very moment, I am currently working on: </p> 

<ul id="nowhead">
<li> Becoming fluent in Mandarin & working on my Cantonese </li>
<li> Working on becoming a better programmer by redesigning someone's website and doing a little more javascript & data visualization </li>
<li> Working on my <a href="photos.stevenchan.co">photography</a>. It's not bad but there's a lot more I want to learn and a lot more room for improvement. You're not really improving if you don't have your own work. </li>
<li> Starting indoor rock climbing as an excuse for doing boring exercises like lifting or running </li>
<li> Starting some jiu jitsu classes because I want to be a badass </li>
<li> Reading a bit more now that I'm out of school - Trying to read at least 1 book a month and alternating between fiction and nonfiction. But let's be honest, ficition is a lot easier. </li>
</ul>
