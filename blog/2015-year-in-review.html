        <h2> 2015: Year in Review </h2>
        <p> December 28, 2015 </p>

        <p> So I recently came to the realization that I often try to measure my life in hours & days rather than weeks and months. I tend to forget that progress takes time and is nothing like cramming for an exam in college. Plus, I can barely remember what I did last week so this should be interesting to see how and what I’ve spent my time on this year. Obviously, this is not going to encompass everything that I’ve done because 1) I’m not that neurotic and 2) my gcal isn’t as up to date as I’d like it to be. Nonetheless, this’ll be interesting.</p>

        </div> 

        <p>I’m definitely missing some stuff and I chose not to include anything related to work unless it was something new or influential for me. It’s interesting to see an entire year reduced to mere bullet points — it goes to show just how many things I did this year that I felt were important to me. That being said, there were also things that are important to me that I didn’t include — like meeting with friends and family. Or somewhere along the way I got some of my photos featured but I don’t think that was too big of an achievement for me to put it down. I guess one take away from all this is that I need to better consolidate the events of my life into one location. I also will need to start doing this on a monthly basis so I don’t have to bounce between my Google Calendar, Facebook, Instagram, etc. to figure out what I did. Plus, I think that’ll let me iterate a little faster so I can focus more efficiently on my goals. </p>

        <p>I hope you all enjoyed your 2015 and if you do something like this for yourself, please share with me. I’m very interested to see what people consider accomplishments for themselves & what their lives are like. Happy holidays everyone! </p>
        <br>
