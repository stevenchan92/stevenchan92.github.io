			 	Entrepreneurship did not truly strike me until my junior year of undergrad when I started second-guessing medical school. By chance, I entered a yearlong social entrepreneurship competition at NYU and ended up winning the entire thing. As I saw my ideas come to life, I was captivated by what I could suddenly do and delved head first into the startup ecosystem. <br> <br>

				I started attending as many startup events and panels as possible which eventually led me to <a href="http://techatnyu.org" target="_blank">Tech@NYU </a>, NYC's largest student-led organization bolstering tech culture among students and the larger community. In 2013, I joined on as Head of Business Development and helped bring the world of possibilities I felt earlier to students and developers. Around then, I was also selected as NYU's <a href="http://www.dalailamafellows.org/fellow/steven-chan/" target="_blank">Dalai Lama Fellow</a>. Since then, I've come to realize that I want to design and create better systems that allow for better human experiences and empower others to maximize their potential. <br>
